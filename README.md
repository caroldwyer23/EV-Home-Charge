# EV-Home-Charge
Peer to peer charging facility for electric vehicle battery charge points.
Focus on two user groups User and Provider.

The User groups should be able to create a profile and search google maps for available times to rent home charging points from the Provider.

The provider should be able to register to create a profile and display their locations to users on google maps. 
There should be a location tag to show available times that the provider has set as available. 

The user should request a booking time and the provider should be able to approve this.
